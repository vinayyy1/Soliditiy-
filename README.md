# UniqueToken Solidity Contract

## Overview:
The "UniqueToken" Solidity contract serves as a foundation for creating custom digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to provide developers with a practical understanding of token implementation within blockchain technology. Equipped with functions for minting and burning tokens, this contract offers a straightforward approach for managing tokenized assets.

## Getting Started:
To utilize this contract, you'll need Remix, an online tool for coding and testing on Ethereum. Follow these steps:
1. Visit [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and create a new file named "UniqueToken.sol."
2. Copy and paste the provided code into the file.
3. Click the "Compile" button to ensure correct setup and compilation.
4. Deploy the contract to commence interaction.

## Working:
Once deployed, engage with the contract using the "mintTokens" and "burnTokens" functions:
- **Minting Tokens**: Creates new tokens and assigns them to specified addresses.
- **Burning Tokens**: Destroys tokens from specific addresses, reducing the total token supply.
Ensure accurate input details when utilizing these functions. Additionally, verify token balances to confirm ownership.

## Code Explanation:

1. Basic Information Storage: Initialization of variables to store token details such as name, symbol, and total supply.
2. Token Ownership Tracking: Utilization of a mapping structure to track token balances per address.
3. Minting Tokens: Implementation of the "mintTokens" function to generate new tokens, incrementing the total supply and recipient balances.
4. Burning Tokens: Development of the "burnTokens" function to destroy tokens, ensuring the sender possesses adequate balance before execution.
